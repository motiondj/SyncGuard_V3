    Version: v1.13.1
    Notes: The library consists of header files, static libraries and dynamically linked libraries. All three will be added and used used in the engine. Headers and static libraries are used to access the functionality of the shared library. While the headers and static libraries are compiled into the standalone application, the dynamic libraries are distributed along with it. The software is thus used, internally, by licencees as well as end consumers.
